Hello! I see that you're interested in this app! This app has been put together using `NodeJs`, along with `Express` and `React` as the templating engine! Its purpose is really simple -- For you to store the links within articles you are reading, so that you can access them later.
###### TL: DR;
It helps ensure you don't have a **million** tabs open on Google Chrome.

###### 1. Create an Account
###### 2. Click on Bookmarks
###### 3. Click on New Bookmark
###### 4. Enter a title that will help you remember what the article is about
###### 5. Enter the URL of the article & click Submit
###### 6. Choose the URL's you wish to retain
###### 7. Tadah! You're Done!
